				Paper tickets, tokens, and smart cards are just a few of the transportation ticketing systems available in the Philippines. However, with the rapid expansion of smartphones that most commuters use while on transit, setting the ticketing system on mobile saves time, money, and manual labor. Allow passengers to pay their ride, book a destination, and scan through security gates effortlessly through their smartphone. Get onboard on the mobile ticketing solution with TransBox.

				TransBox is a platform of MultiSys designed for transport network vehicle management, e.g. registration, booking, route mapping, e-payment, and client-feedback.
